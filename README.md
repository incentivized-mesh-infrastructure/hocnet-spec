This repository is used to store concept papers for the Hocnet mesh network.

As the number of connected individuals and devices expands the `last mile` continues to be the greatest challenge both in the connected and developing worlds, representing a disproportional portion of the cost and difficulty of connecting the world.

Ad-Hoc networks are a type of network where there is no dedicated infrastructure such as switches or routers and instead these tasks are handled by the participating users in a distributed fashion. Mesh networks are a derivative of Ad-Hoc networks in that dedicated hardware for routing is used and encouraged but not ultimately required for the functionality of the network. 

In this repositry we propose a plethora of additions to the existing mesh network protocol Batman-Adv and the creation of entierly new pieces of software with the goal of creating a 'decentralized last mile' where each node competes to be paid to carry traffic via the most efficient route it can use. Furthermore we will encourage the use of so called `Ad-Hoc infrastructure` where users may implement dedicated hardware such as directional antennas, IR links, or simply mundane wires to produce better and more profitable routes for their nodes to advertise.

We hope that by lowering the barrier of entry to providing connectivity services we can both decrease the cost of connecting the developing world and provide an environment that fosters competition in otherwise monopolistic last mile infrastructure in developed countries.
